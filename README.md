e.  Tool - jQuery
    Why - My portfolio piece pages felt too stark and uninteractive so I wanted to give them more of a feeling of anticipation.
    How - Added fade in effects to my pages so that the elements appear as you scroll
    Changes color of small screen hamburger menu when clicked
    Adds - Gives it more of an interactive, anticipatory feeling instead of feeling so immediate and dull

    Tool - Animations
    Why - The home page felt static and dull but I didn't want to add more colorful elements or images because I wanted to keep the website simple
    How - Typewriter animations on the less serious pages to lighten the air
    Adds - Gives the website more of a casual feeling and also adds more anticipation, especially on the home page since it types multiple different things

f.  Iterations from HW #7 - More informational header with work dropdown
    More interactive way to take a quick glance at the different pieces and choose which one you want to take a look at
    Changed main color and added some more colorful aspects

g.  Major Challenges - Keeping track to make sure the website was responsive
    Adjusting small details (sizes, alignment, visibility, colors, etc.)
    Implementing jQuery
