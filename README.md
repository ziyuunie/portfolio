V.  
Tool - jQuery  
Why - My portfolio piece pages felt too stark and uninteractive so I wanted to give them more of a feeling of anticipation.  
How - Added fade in effects to my pages so that the elements appear as you scroll  
Changes color of small screen hamburger menu when clicked  
Adds - Gives it more of an interactive, anticipatory feeling instead of feeling so immediate and dull  

Tool - Animations  
Why - The home page felt static and dull but I didn't want to add more colorful elements or images because I wanted to keep the website simple  
How - Typewriter animations on the less serious pages to lighten the air  
Adds - Gives the website more of a casual feeling and also adds more anticipation, especially on the home page since it types multiple different things  

VI.  
Iterations from HW #7 - More informational header with work dropdown, more interactive way to take a quick glance at the all different pieces and choose which one you want to take a closer look at, changed main point color, and added some more colorful aspects

VII.  
Major Challenges - Keeping track to make sure the website was responsive, adjusting small details (sizes, alignment, visibility, colors, etc.), and implementing jQuery
